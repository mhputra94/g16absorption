# Absorption Spectra of TDDFT Results from Gaussian 16 

Here, we provide a python based tool for plotting absorption spectra from TDDFT Result of Gaussian 16. Although, we can plot the spectra by using extra software from Gaussian Inc, so called Gaussview, but the broadening factor (σ) is fixed 0.4 eV (as long as I know). Nevertheless, there is possible that another number of broadening yield better spectra incorporated to the experimental result. By applying this code, we can tune the broadening parameter
